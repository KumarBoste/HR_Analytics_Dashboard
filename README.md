# HR Analytics Dashboard ( Tableau ) 

## Project Objective
The primary objective of the HR Analytics Dashboard is to analyze employee-related data to help HR teams make data-driven workforce decisions.
This dashboard focuses on understanding employee attrition, workforce demographics, job satisfaction, performance trends, and departmental distribution to improve employee retention, productivity, and organizational efficiency.

## Problem Definition & Key Business Questions
#### Problem Definition
Organizations face challenges in managing employee attrition, maintaining workforce satisfaction, and optimizing human resource strategies. Without analytical insights, HR decisions are often reactive rather than proactive.

#### Key Questions Based on Insights
- What is the overall employee attrition rate?
- Which departments and job roles have the highest attrition?
- How does age, gender, and education impact attrition?
- Is there a relationship between job satisfaction, performance rating, and attrition?
- Does salary level and years at company influence employee turnover?
- Which employee segments are at higher risk of leaving?

## Statistical Analysis
The following analytical methods are used in the project:

#### Descriptive Statistics
- Total employees
- Active employees
- Attrition count and attrition rate
- Percentage & Ratio Analysis
- Attrition by department, gender, age group

#### Trend Analysis
- Attrition across experience levels and tenure

#### Comparative Analysis
- Job satisfaction vs attrition
- Salary slab vs attrition

#### Distribution Analysis
- Workforce distribution across departments, job roles, and education fields

## Data Visualization & Insights
#### Key Visuals Used
- KPI Cards: Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate
- Bar Charts: Attrition by Department, Job Role, Age Group
- Pie / Donut Charts: Gender-wise employee distribution
- Stacked Charts: Job satisfaction vs attrition
- Heatmaps: Performance rating vs attrition
- Filters: Department, Gender, Education, Job Role

#### Insights Derived
- Certain departments show significantly higher attrition rates
- Employees with low job satisfaction have a higher probability of leaving
- Attrition is more prominent in early career stages
- Lower salary slabs show higher employee turnover
- Male/Female attrition varies across departments and roles
